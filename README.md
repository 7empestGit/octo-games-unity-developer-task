# Endless Shooter

## Introduction

Welcome to Endless Shooter, an endless third-person shooter game developed using Unity Engine. The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to work with Unity assets to create a quick prototype. The game is built for the PC platform and will provide a fun and exciting experience for players.

## Assets Used

The following assets were used to build the game:

- POLYGON Apocalypse
- GUI PRO Kit - Sci-Fi Survival
- Third Person Controller by Opsive
- Cartoon FX Remaster
- SkySeries Freebie

## Development Plan

To manage the development of the game, I used the following plan:

1. **Stage 1 - Level Design (30x30 units)**
   - A small but attractive level was built using the POLYGON Apocalypse asset.
   - The lighting was set up to create an attractive evening atmosphere, with additional sources of light.
   - Post-processing was used to improve the overall look of the scene.
   - The SkyBox was created using the SkySeries Freebie asset.

2. **Stage 2 - Main Character**
   - A third-person controller was set up using the Third Person Controller by Opsive asset.
   - The character was set up using any model from the environment pack.
   - The character was equipped with shooting capabilities (ammo is limited).
   - Movement animation was replaced using Mixamo.com.
   - A primitive enemy (zombie) was added to the game. The zombie will attack the player and will have an endless spawn.
   - On death, the zombie will become a Ragdoll and will be thrown away with the last shot.

3. **Stage 3 - UI & SFX**
   - Display of character health using the GUI PRO Kit - Sci-Fi Survival asset.
   - Display of the number of killed opponents.
   - Display of the type of weapon and the amount of ammunition.
   - A small menu was added at the start of the game and an additional window on death with a suggestion to repeat or exit, with display of results at death.
   - Sound effects were added for gameplay actions (such as shooting, moving, getting damage, gunshots, death sounds, music, etc.).
   - Sound effects were added for UI elements.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to work with Unity assets and manage the development process from start to finish. I hope you enjoy playing Endless Shooter!
